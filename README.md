> Welcome to data mining! This is an applied course meant to teach you practical tools for data mining and knowledge discovery. The course is composed of three units: prediction of continuous outcomes, classification, and unsupervised learning. The goal is to provide experience in a breadth of applications and to prepare you for the job of an analyst, data scientist, or any role that calls for data mining. If you already have previous experience with R or data mining, there are additional readings and techniques in the projects to challenge you and elevate your skills.

## Course Grade

Grading is based on classroom participation, completion of homework and projects, and attendance. Students are required to attend 80% of the lectures to receive a passing grade.

## Assignments

#### [Projects](https://github.com/erinshellman/BI-TECH-CP303/tree/master/projects)

There are three projects, one in each topic area. For each project, you will receive a business problem and a corresponding data set. You're free to use any methods you like, so long as you support your choices. You will write a brief report of your analyses and provide/receive feedback from your classmates. You will have time in class to ask questions and work on your projects.

#### Critiques

When you turn in your project reports, you will receive the reports of three of your classmates. During the following week, read their reports and provide thoughts and feedback. Please write at least a paragraph discussing parts of the analyses you liked and disliked.  While you're reading, try to put yourself into the mind of the business stakeholder and ask if your requests were adequately met. Are you confident in the conclusions drawn? Were the figures and supporting evidence compelling? Remember to maintain a tone of mutual respect and read the section on policies and values for more information.

## Textbook

There is no required textbook for this course. Everything you need to succeed is available in the course repository.

## Policies and values

A large component of this course is in-class discussion and providing critical feedback on the analyses of your peers. It is imperative that all students are thoughtful when providing written feedback and participating in class. This means using respectful language in discussions and writings, but also being respectful of our limited class time by arriving prepared and engaged.

Everyone is required to do original work for all projects. You're free to openly discuss the projects and your approaches, just like you would in a professional setting, but reports should be your own.

Students with disabilities requiring addition services can find resources at the [UW Disability Resources for Students](http://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/) page.

## Software Installation

We'll be using the statistical programming language R for this course. In addition, I highly recommend that you use RStudio, a powerful interactive development environment (IDE) for R. If you plan to use your own laptop computer in class, please install R and RStudio on your laptop before the first day of class. The computers in the classroom will have everything you need installed.

1. [Download and install R](http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/)
2. [Download and install RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
